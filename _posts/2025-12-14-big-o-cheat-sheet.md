##  Big O Notation -- Summary & Concepts

###  What is Big O?
* Big O describes how runtime (or space) scales with input size.
* It's used to evaluate the efficiency of algorithms.
* Think of it as a way to express "how slow or fast" an algorithm gets as the input grows.

###  Pigeon vs Internet Analogy
**Scenario:** Data sent via Internet vs. Pigeon with USB stick (2009 South Africa).

**Observation:**
* Pigeon always takes about the same time (constant): `O(1)`
* Internet time grows with data size (linear): `O(n)`

** Lesson:** Big O ignores constants and focuses on growth rate with input size.

###  Code Examples
* **Linear Search through array:** `O(n)`
* **Printing all pairs from array:** `O(n²)`
* **Mowing a square field:**
    * Area-based: `O(a)` where a = area
    * Side-length-based: `O(s²)` where s = side length

###  4 Core Rules of Big O

#### 1.  Additive Time
If two steps run one after another, add runtimes: → e.g., `O(a) + O(b)`
* **Example:** Walk through two different arrays.

#### 2.  Drop Constants
Don't write `O(2n)` or `O(3n)` → just say `O(n)`.
* **Focus:** Growth rate, not exact steps.

#### 3.  Use Different Variables for Different Inputs
**Example:** Comparing elements in two arrays of size **a** and **b**.
*  Incorrect: `O(n²)`
*  Correct: `O(a * b)`

#### 4.  Drop Non-Dominant Terms
If algorithm has `O(n + n²)` → simplify to `O(n²)`.
* The highest order term dominates.
