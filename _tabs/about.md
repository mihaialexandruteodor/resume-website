## Hey there! 👋

I figured I'll let ChatGPT take a break and write my own introduction, since I'm old enough ('97) to have lived through the forums of early web 2.0 era 😂

My name is Teo and I've worked for five years now as a Software Developer, mainly in full stack roles! 📚

I don't have a favorite language and like to adapt to whatever tech stack is thrown at me! What I learned in all those years is that reading the documentation, reaching out to an experienced colleague or placing a few breakpoints here and there and watching the code in action is the secret recipe for settling in into any role.

In my spare time, I tinker with setup scripts for my Linux desktop or my Mac, but I also like to write, draw, read and watch movies. 📽️

I created this website both as a resume and as a way to keep all my regularly used code readily accessible. Instead of digging through my notes or github repos, I'd rather just have it all here, centralized on a searchable website, with the added benefit that it might also save others the headache of searching for the solution to a problem I also encountered.

Finally, thanks for stopping by, and check out my posts!
