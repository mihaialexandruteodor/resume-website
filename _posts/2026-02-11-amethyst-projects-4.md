I had a change of heart after realizing that I will be the only person with full access to backend on this platform witch will basically be and IMDb for webnovels:

- it will be a headache to implement a ranking algorithm
- it won't be fully transparent how and if the user actions are the sole factors in calculating the score for each novel.

So I decided to take this out of my hands (lol). And implement an average system that will be much more transparent. Below is a screenshot from my Obsidian notes:
