I am starting today a new project called **Amethyst** that I want to hopefully grow into a (non-profit) online platform.

As obvious from my [Master's Thesis in 2020](https://github.com/mihaialexandruteodor/FeatherWriter), a fairly crude cloud-based Scrivener alternative (my current setup is a more elegant mix of **Obsidian** and **Pandoc**), I am quite interested in the writing and publishing world.

Unlike that project, Amethyst will be (at first) a mobile application which allows users to serialize webnovels or link to pre-existing published ones, either on **Amazon KDE** or on various websited for serialized work like **RoyalRoad**, **AO3** and so on.

The first hurdle to pass is in designing an app that allows for user registration, and cannot be easily exploited by bots or malicious actors (I am very afraid of releasing this into the world and receiving an egregious monthly bill for cloud services).

My current bet is on **Android + Supabase**, and I am following this tutorial to get the boilerplate app up and running. If things go well, I'll expand to a **web platform** and an **iOS** version down the line, but the plan is to do the system design first for the Android app, and do it properly, with some future planning in mind for these two platforms.

The development of the project will be done on a private repo.

Hope this goes well!
